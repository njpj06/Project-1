# About
This website at the click of a button produces a random word with its definition. The instructions for this website are the followings: When you click the button Then a word is displayed along with its current definition if it does not have a definition the phrase "No definition for this one! ðŸ˜” " will appear. When the page is refreshed so are the word and definition. This website uses two APIS a wordapi and a dictionaryapi to come up with these results.
