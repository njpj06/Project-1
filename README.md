# About
This website at the click of a button produces a random word with its definition, if one is provided. The instructions for this website are the following: When you click the button, a word is displayed along with its current definition. If it does not have a definition, the phrase "No definition for this one! ðŸ˜”" will appear. When the page is refreshed, so are the word and definition. This website uses Words API and Webster Dictionary API to get these results.
